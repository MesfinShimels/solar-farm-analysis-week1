 README for Analysis Jupyter Notebook

 Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for data analysis and processing. It includes code for importing libraries, loading data, and performing initial exploratory operations on datasets. The notebook is structured with clear sections for easier navigation.

 Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed in your Python environment:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `os`
  - `sys`

Additionally, custom scripts located in the `../scripts` directory are referenced for specific functions. Ensure this directory is accessible and contains the required files.

 File Structure
- Notebook: `analysis.ipynb`
- Data Folder: `../Data/`
  - Includes raw data files (e.g., `raw_analyst_ratings.csv`).
- Scripts Folder: `../scripts/`
  - Contains custom Python scripts for data loading and processing.

 Usage
1. Setup the Environment:
   - Add the `../scripts` folder to your Python path using:
     ```python
     sys.path.append(os.path.abspath("../scripts"))
     ```

2. Load Dataset:
   - Define the file path for your dataset. Example:
     ```python
     file_path = "../Data/raw_analyst_ratings.csv"
     ```
   - Use the provided function `load_dataset` to read the file:
     ```python
     data_frame = load_dataset(file_path)
     ```

3. Inspect Data:
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset to ensure it loaded correctly:
     ```python
     print(data_frame.head())
     ```

 Notes
- Ensure the relative paths for data and scripts are correct before running the notebook.
- Update library versions if compatibility issues arise.

 Future Enhancements
- Expand markdown documentation to include detailed explanations of each step.
- Add error handling for data loading and path issues.
- Include visualizations and deeper data insights.
