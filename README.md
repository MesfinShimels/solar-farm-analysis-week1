Stock Market Analyzer
Overview
The Stock Market Analyzer project is designed to analyze the relationship between stock market trends and the sentiment of news headlines. The aim is to build a modular, reusable codebase that follows software engineering best practices, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and alignment with data science workflows.
Background
This project integrates diverse datasets, such as stock market data and news headlines, to extract valuable insights, create visualizations, and perform advanced analyses. Python is used to build an efficient and structured framework for data handling and exploration.
Key concepts introduced in the project include:
•	Data Loading: Reading datasets from various file formats.
•	Data Analysis: Summarizing and exploring datasets to identify trends, correlations, and patterns.
•	Market Analysis: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment and relevance of news headlines.
•	Data Visualization: Creating plots and graphs to understand the relationship between stock market trends and news sentiment.
The repository structure, coding conventions, and modularity are designed to facilitate collaborative development.

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/MesfinShimels/week1.git
cd StockMarketAnalyzer
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Loader Example
from scripts.data_loader import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader("Data/stock_data.csv")
data = loader.load_data()
print(data.head())
Data Analysis Example
from scripts.data_analysis import DataAnalyzer

analyzer = DataAnalyzer(data)
analyzer.display_summary()
analyzer.check_missing_values()
Market Analysis Example
from scripts.market_analysis import MarketAnalyzer

analyzer = MarketAnalyzer("Data/news_headlines.csv")
market_scores = analyzer.analyze_markets()
print(market_scores)
Data Visualization Example
from scripts.data_visualization import DataVisualizer
visualizer = DataVisualizer(data, market_scores)
visualizer.plot_correlation()
visualizer.plot_trends()
Testing
Run the tests to ensure the scripts are functioning as expected:
python -m unittest discover tests/

Best Practices
•	Commit Often: Make small, frequent commits with meaningful messages.
•	Use Branches: Work on separate branches for features and bug fixes to avoid conflicts.
•	Keep the Main Branch Stable: Only merge tested code into the main branch.
•	Collaborate: Communicate effectively with your team to manage changes.
